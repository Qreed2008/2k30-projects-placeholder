# Q-maker
A Super Mario Maker 2 replica, originally thought up as an alternative to Mario Multiverse, but is now intended to be a super extensive version of the original.

With 2D *and* 3D editing modes, and custom settings (present in Advanced Editor mode), anything *truly is* possible in this editor.



Advanced editor is great for troll levels :D

I mean, just look at the [examples](https://scratchblocks.github.io/#?style=scratch2&script=block%20properties%20%3A%3A%20hat%20%2F%2F%20Properties%20for%20the%20%22fish%20block%22%20(multi-coin%20%3F%20block%20with%20fish)%0Aobject%20position%20by%20block%3A%20x%20(9)%20y%20(9)%0Asprite%20position%20by%20block%3A%20x%20(9)%20y%20(10)%0Astart%20as%20invisible%20%5Bno%20v%5D%0Ais%20invisible%20after%20hit%20%5Bno%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20If%20you%20have%20this%20as%20yes%20but%20not%20start%20as%20invisible%2C%20it%20disappears%20after%20hit.%0Adisappears%20after%20%5B10%5Dth%20hit%20%2F%2F%20Only%20active%20if%20the%20one%20above%20this%20is.%20(is%20invisible%20after%20hit)%0Alose%20hitbox%20when%20invisible%20%5Bno%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20%22Yes%22%20makes%20it%20have%20no%20hitbox%20when%20invisible.%0A%0Aon%20%5B9%5Dth%20hit%20of%20this%20block%20%3A%3A%20events%20hat%20%2F%2F%20multi-coin%20%3F%20block%20(Every%20block%20has%20this%20lol)%0Aspawn%20entity%20(edit%20entity%20properties)%20%3A%3A%20control%20%2F%2F%20Yes%2C%20the%20circle%20thing%20is%20(intended%20to%20be)%20a%20button.%0A%0Aentity%20properties%20%3A%3A%20hat%20%2F%2F%20fish%20from%20the%20multi-coin%20%3F%20block%0Aobject%20%5Bfish%20v%5D%0Asprite%20display%20%5BDefault%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20Custom%20can%20be%20added%0Abig%20%5Byes%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20When%20you%20use%20a%20mushroom%20on%20an%20enemy%0Afire%20%5Byes%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20When%20a%20fish%20touches%20lava%2C%20it%20comes%20back%20up%20on%20fire.%20That's%20what%20this%20is%20about.%0Acolor%20%5Bgreen%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20There%20is%20red%20and%20green%20fish.%0Acolor-based%20movement%20%5Bgreen%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20They%20also%20had%20different%20movement%20types.%20(When%20swimming%2C%20green%20always%20goes%20a%20single%20direction%2C%20but%20red%20goes%20back%20and%20forth.)%0Aearn%20on%20entity%20death%20%5B3%5D%20%5B1-up%20v%5D%20%2F%2F%20Made%20from%20an%20idea%20I%20had%20for%20an%20Automatic%20Mario%20Maker%20(Mario%20Maker%20except%20for%20designing%20Auto%20Mario%20levels)%0Aspawns%20facing%20%5Bleft%20v%5D%0A%0Aentity%20properties%20%3A%3A%20hat%20%2F%2F%20spring%20that%20kills%20on%20touch%20(vars%20that%20aren't%20there%20are%20default)%0Aobject%20%5Bspring%20v%5D%0Akill%20on%20touch%20%5Byes%20v%5D%0A%0Alevel%20settings%20%3A%3A%20hat%0Amusic%20%5BSMB1%3A%20Overworld%20v%5D%20%3A%3A%20sound%0Atheme%20%5BSMB2%20USA%20v%5D%20%5BOverworld%20v%5D%20%3A%3A%20looks%0Abackground%20%5BSMB3%3A%20Overworld%20v%5D%20%3A%3A%20looks%0Aplayer%20sound%20set%20%5BSMAS-SMB3%20v%5D%20%3A%3A%20sound%0Aentity%20sound%20set%20%5BSMAS-SMB3%20v%5D%20%3A%3A%20sound%0A%0AEditor%20mode%20player%20settings%20%3A%3A%20hat%0Aplayer%20%5BMario%20v%5D%0Aplayer%20sprite%20%5BMario%20(automatic%20to%20theme)%20v%5D), especially the ? block one.

The custom editor includes many other things too. For example, you can change what physics the level has.
